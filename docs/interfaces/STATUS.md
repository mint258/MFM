# Model/data interface status

2026-10-26最新：整份模型指南仍未完成。A采样桥接+B候选wire/provider已完成独立与整合回归；最新Root3789c19865f70f80191986675cb13b606ebd210b为2473PASS/2CUDA skip、104文件，实际4项A→B→原trainer贯通全PASS。新独立C4组合检查则为48FAIL/9控制PASS，误差归因继续，不将原单独测试当组合接受。见[候选接口与完整限制](../model_v3/03_candidate_interfaces_20261026.md)及[289条原时间点审计](../model_v3/COMPLETION_AUDIT_20261026_v1.md)。D1draft.3可读而未最终冻结，最终D3–D7未交；没有最终recipe/B*、main更新、tag或正式预训练授权。

The user explicitly confirmed on 2026-10-25 that D-1 through D-6 are not yet
delivered and instructed the model line to continue S and synthetic work.
The model line proceeds with existing S inputs and clearly marked synthetic
fixtures while these interfaces are pending. Existing WP5 family Parquet and
the historical target-fidelity registry are not replacements for D-1/D-2.

Stage gates: 0 baseline report; 1 profiler evidence on three GPU types; 2
numeric/trajectory and bf16 evidence; 3 real-data head/loss acceptance; 4
TRAIN-only evaluator and integration; 5 architecture decisions; 6 recipe/B-star
plus user confirmation; 7 freeze/tag/real smoke/PR. No stage is accepted by
preparing its implementation alone. No formal pretraining is authorized here.

Latest model-line observations: source public at
`61658a4c1f472de035601dbedc17809315774784`; post-merge406 passed 2,196 tests
with one CUDA skip. Native A00 controls405/410/411 passed their actual
20-batch gates; paired500 trajectories remain pending. Architecture branch412
and post-merge415 passed complete regression; scientific decisions await data/evidence.
Existing downstream metadata was resealed in413 with zero target decoding and
exactly the379 members/groups/roles/contracts. Real store421 completed17,602
selected TRAIN records with exact cohort replay and zero outer-target decoding,
after all2,096 SA-3 tests passed420. Full panel execution remains pending.
No new D-1–D-6 delivery is inferred from this model-owned existing-data projection.

2026-10-25 update: actual B3 nine-task/two-readout evaluation437 completed
18 cells, Slurm C0/543s, inclusive guard wall541.230s. It is a historical384
sanity check; independent native SDK verification/archive is pending. Do not
use its result for v3 architecture selection or claim512 timing acceptance.
C2 user-confirmed local-geometry bins to3D denoising vectors; branch441 passed
2,187 tests/one CUDA skip. Root392 passed2,255/one skip in443. Integration
and public preregistration remain required before real C2 fitting. CPU node20
is fully occupied by another user's104-CPU job; a temporary21/22 CPU exception
has been requested under the user's AGENTS rule, not assumed. Existing jobs
and the data line are untouched. D-1 throughD-6 remain user-confirmed pending.

Subsequent user instruction resolves CPU placement: submit CPU work to
available CPU nodes; GPU nodes are reserved for model training/fine-tuning
and other GPU jobs. Therefore the proposed21/22 CPU exception is not used.
Current site CPU partition is compute-0-2 and8–19; Root checks live allocations,
all-user requested memory and actual available memory before each admission.
C2 method is now publicly preregistered at1a8c124571ddf37f87ae06ef9971efa85e417f95,
with tree exactly equal to local dd6cbaf. Integration regression precedes fitting.

Latest verified integrations: export478–481 PASS2,285/one skip; precision498–501
PASS2,294/one skip; plan506–509 PASS2,306/one skip. All are complete disjoint
CPU regression partitions with actual C0 closures. Decision39 unit cases and
premerge502–505 PASS2,319/one skip precede a separate postmerge regression.
B3 independent487 SDK verification is complete (170,299 native records /
56,738 history, exact metrics/clean EOF/exit0); historical384 limitations remain.
A06 fused457 failed the original500-step trajectory gate; it is not adopted.
Fresh A00 export486 completed C0 and awaits explicit outer-terminal admission
before the primary512 panel. C2 fit482 failed during TRAIN solving, before any
validation geometry read; v1 remains failed pending a separately registered
TRAIN-only solver diagnosis. D-1–D-6 remain pending, with no delivery inferred.

Current toolchain evidence: primary512 run544 completed C0/512s, full9 tasks /
18 readout cells /1000 molecular-bootstrap draws, matched random512, cold cache.
Actual guard including cleanup509.330s and1.609GB output satisfy this run's1h/
2GiB budgets. Independent566 verified170,295 native SDK records /56,738 history,
every scalar and global step, clean EOF/exit0. It is an A00 short500 checkpoint,
not sufficiently trained-model or architecture acceptance; single-seed SD is
unavailable. Full reports/typed run CSV preserve all cells and negative results.
Root postmerge533–536 passed2,368/one CUDA skip. Stage4 overall still awaits
D-3 all-label SDP2000-update smoke on all three GPU types. C2 diagnostic559
is TRAIN-only and preregistered publiclycd0c434, original482 staysFAILED.
Archive562 completed with41 unique offline runs, including failed evidence and
independently verified synthetic resume513/514; no online sync is claimed.

D-1 throughD-6 remain user-confirmed not delivered. No final model/recipe freeze,
no main update or school-server job; overall guide acceptance remains pending.

2026-10-25 new observation: D-1 draft.3 and draft registry are now readable in
runs/data_v1_20261025/repository. Model review covers31 SHA-bound source files
and264 registry metadata rows, no scientific data or tests run for this review.
Opinions were appended under the actual contract's model-line section, preserving
its entire original15581-byte prefix; before/afterSHA receipt is published with
docs/model_v3/03_D1_draft3_review.md. Data wire tensor6/source-specific D5/sparse
reasons andr82 scatter already exist; remaining model consumption and scientific
contracts are distinguished explicitly. No v3.0 signature or D3–D6 final delivery
is inferred. An independent old-native S bond transport gap is being repaired
in isolated model-v3-s-bond-transport; no new wire codebook/physical-label decision.

2026-10-25 S native bond loader fix VERIFIED: optional typed old rdkit_bond facts retained through decoded collation.

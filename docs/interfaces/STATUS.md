# Model/data interface status

All dates use Asia/Shanghai. Model-line checkout:
`/share/home/zixiao/descriptor_analysis/MFM_model_v3`, branch `model-v3`.
This file records observations in this checkout; it does not declare external
data-line work absent or override another checkout's delivery state.

| 2026-10-25 | Model stages 1-2 | IMPLEMENTED_IN_WORKTREE, acceptance pending. Existing plus SA-1 suite: 2,040 passed (4520339). First synthetic GPU attempt 4520340 failed before training in source attribution; fix tested 4520342 and committed.

| 2026-10-25 | Model stage 3 | Synthetic loader/head/loss/checkpoint tests passed; S bridge strict parameter-gradient parity passed 4520342 after source-only CPU-thread diagnostic. Integrated trainer under development. Real D-3 acceptance pending | `MFM_model_v3_sa2/docs/model_v3/03_labels_losses.md`; external job 4520338 diagnostic |
| 2026-10-25 | Model stage 4 | User permits existing SoM binary classification for coverage. TRAIN-only target-selective panel/evaluator/packing synthetic tests passed; real metadata bindings and checkpoint evaluation pending | `MFM_model_v3_sa3/configs/dev_panel_v1.json`; 4520342 packing bundle: 27 passed |

The user explicitly confirmed on 2026-10-25 that D-1 through D-6 are not yet
delivered and instructed the model line to continue S and synthetic work.
The model line proceeds with existing S inputs and clearly marked synthetic
fixtures while these interfaces are pending. Existing WP5 family Parquet and
the historical target-fidelity registry are not replacements for D-1/D-2.

Stage gates: 0 baseline report; 1 profiler evidence on three GPU types; 2
numeric/trajectory and bf16 evidence; 3 real-data head/loss acceptance; 4
TRAIN-only evaluator and integration; 5 architecture decisions; 6 recipe/B-star
plus user confirmation; 7 freeze/tag/real smoke/PR. No stage is accepted by
preparing its implementation alone. No formal pretraining is authorized here.
